            <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reduce the cost
                of education per student, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) had introduced the new
                scheme from the 2009-10 academic year, namely the “Integrated Campus”. This new scheme allows
                institutions to optimally utilize their infrastructure. Under this scheme, a society or trust running
                different types of institutions under AICTE’s purview on contiguous land sites can share a joint campus
                with common amenities like a common library, canteen, computer centre, auditorium or playground etc.,
                which saves money on land and infrastructure investments. This scheme has reduces the land requirements
                by 20 per cent. It’s a mini deemed university without going through the procedures required for deemed
                university status. In integrated campuses only infrastructure would be shared, and not the academics.
                The facility can be availed by existing educational groups of institutes as well as new one.</span>

                    Colleges can generate enormous amounts of plastic waste, which is toxic to people and the
